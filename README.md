# Logistic-Regression
This project centers on the evaluation of classifiers for diagnosing breast cancers as benign or malignant. The primary objective is to utilize breast cancer data, derived from digitized images of breast masses, to train and assess the performance of four distinct classifiers: Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, Perceptron, and Logistic Regression. The script involves reading the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and employing 5-fold cross-validation to determine the average accuracy of each classifier. Notably, Logistic Regression emerges as the classifier with the highest cross-validation accuracy.

Following the classifier evaluation, the project delves into the regularization of logistic regression. Seven different values for the regularization parameter C are experimented with, and the script reports the average 5-fold cross-validation accuracy for each value. The optimal value for C is identified, and its corresponding accuracy is highlighted. Subsequent tasks focus on precision, recall, and F1 score computation, considering the optimal regularization parameter. Additionally, the impact of feature scaling on the logistic regression classifier's F1 score is explored using the StandardScaler. The project provides a comprehensive exploration of logistic regression in the context of breast cancer diagnosis, covering classifier evaluation, regularization, and performance metrics.
